    "reasoning": "The AI-generated answer not only covers the basic information present in the ground answer but significantly expands upon it with additional useful details. It correctly identifies SendGrid as the available email service and mentions the requirement for an API key (through the request process). The answer goes beyond the basic response by providing:\n1. Detailed features (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)\n2. Availability information across cloud providers\n3. Specific instructions on how to request access (ServiceNow form link)\n4. Additional documentation references\n5. Architecture context (production/non-production environments)\nAll information provided aligns with the context and expands upon the ground answer without contradicting it.",

Question 1:
Response: {
    "is_correct": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated answer not only includes the essential information from the ground answer (the ServiceNow ticket link for new TFE project) but also provides additional valuable context and details. It goes beyond by:
    1. Including both relevant ServiceNow forms (new project and team access)
    2. Providing step-by-step instructions for the request process
    3. Including relevant documentation links
    4. Adding contact information for support
    5. Maintaining accuracy with the source context
    6. Structuring the information in a clear, readable format

    The answer expands upon the ground answer in a helpful way while maintaining accuracy to the source material.",

Question 2:
Response: {
    "is_correct": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated answer does not directly address the question about supported AWS services. Instead, it focuses on ServiceNow request forms and general AWS cloud provider information. The ground answer clearly lists the specific AWS services supported: EC2, SQL Server (IaaS), RDS, EFS/FSX, and S3. While the AI's answer includes valuable information about AWS at CBRE, it fails to answer the core question about supported services. The context provided in the documents actually contains this information in a clear table format, which should have been used to provide a direct answer.",

    },
    "explanation_of_metrics": {
        "relevance": "Score is 0.4 because while the answer provides AWS-related information, it mostly contains tangential information about forms and processes rather than supported services",
        "completeness": "Score is 0.3 because the answer completely misses listing the actual supported AWS services that were clearly listed in the ground truth",
        "accuracy": "Score is 0.5 because while the information provided is factually correct, it fails to address the specific question asked about supported services"
    }
}

Question 3:
Response: {
    "is_correct": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated answer not only covers the services mentioned in the ground answer but provides more comprehensive information, including specific timelines and additional context. It correctly identifies Azure PostgreSQL, Cosmos DB, and Azure MySQL as upcoming services, and goes beyond by providing specific implementation dates and additional services that will be supported. The answer is well-structured, includes source references, and provides relevant ServiceNow links. The only minor discrepancy is that the ground answer mentions PostgreSQL availability by end of 2024, while the AI response shows January 2025, but this could be due to updated roadmap information in the context.",

        "accuracy": "Very high score with only minor timeline discrepancy for PostgreSQL implementation date"
    }
}

Question 4:
Response: {
    "is_correct": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated answer is completely different from the ground answer and provides incorrect information. The ground answer specifically focuses on the backup schedule and retention periods for different tiers in a Dedicated subscription:
    - Transaction log backup frequencies (15 mins for Tier 1, 30 mins for Tiers 2-4)
    - Regular backup schedules (12 hours for Tiers 1-2, daily for Tiers 3-4)
    - Weekly backups with 9-week retention for all tiers

    Instead, the AI response provides a general overview of BaaS architecture including regions, resource groups, and processes that aren't specifically related to the backup schedule architecture for Dedicated subscriptions. While some of this information may be valid, it doesn't answer the specific question about backup architecture schedules.",

        "accuracy": 0.1
    }
}

Question 5:
Response: {
    "is_correct": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated answer discusses a completely different RACI matrix for the Enterprise Container Management Platform (ECMP), while the ground answer specifically addresses the RACI matrix for BaaS (Backup as a Service). The AI's response, while structured and detailed, is not relevant to the specific service in question. Key differences include:\n1. Different service focus (ECMP vs BaaS)\n2. Different team roles mentioned\n3. Different responsibilities outlined\n\nMoreover, the context provided in the snippets doesn't actually contain the RACI information for either service, suggesting the AI may be pulling from incomplete or incorrect sources. The ground answer provides specific details about BaaS team responsibilities, including the Platform Team's role in technical aspects, D&T Product Owner's responsibilities, Business Product Owner's consultative role, and GCSO's security oversight.",

        "relevance": 0.2,
        "completeness": 0.5,
        "accuracy": 0.1
    }
}

Note:
- Relevance: 0.2 - While it does provide RACI information, it's for the wrong service entirely
- Completeness: 0.5 - The answer provides a complete RACI structure but for the wrong service
- Accuracy: 0.1 - The information provided doesn't match the ground truth about BaaS service RACI

Question 6:
Response: {
    "is_correct": false,
    "reasoning": "While the AI-generated answer provides extensive details about the BaaS system and restoration process, it fails to directly answer the specific question about SLA timelines. The ground answer clearly states the SLA varies by application type and tier, with specific timeframes for both production and non-production apps. The AI response focuses more on backup frequencies and retention tiers rather than restoration SLAs. It includes additional information about ServiceNow tickets and platform limitations which, while useful, doesn't address the core question about SLA timeframes. The context provided in the image specifically shows the SLA acknowledgment times, which should have been the primary focus of the answer.",
    "metrics": {
        "relevance": 0.6,
        "completeness": 0.4,
        "accuracy": 0.3
    }
}

Explanation of metrics:
- Relevance (0.6): While the answer provides related information about the BaaS system, much of it isn't directly relevant to the SLA timing question
- Completeness (0.4): The answer misses the core SLA timing information that was available in the context, instead focusing on peripheral details
- Accuracy (0.3): The information provided is factually correct but doesn't accurately answer the specific question about SLA timeframes

To be fully correct, the answer should have included:
1. Production app SLAs (Tier 1: ≤1 Hour to Tier 4: ≤1+ day)
2. Non-Production app SLAs (Tier 1: ≤1 Business day to Tier 4: ≤1+ Business days)
3. Clear distinction between production and non-production timelines

Question 7:
Response: {
    "is_correct": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated answer contains several discrepancies and additional information not supported by the ground answer or provided context:\n1. The ground answer specifically mentions Revision 4.5 from May 15, 2025, which is missing in the AI response\n2. The AI response mentions May 16 as the effective date, which contradicts the ground answer's May 15 date\n3. The ground answer emphasizes the requirement for exact matching with APM platform values for four specific tags, which is not clearly highlighted in the AI response\n4. The AI response includes additional information about resources, contact information, and next steps that aren't verified in the ground answer or context\n5. While the AI correctly identifies the new tags, it doesn't emphasize the critical requirement of exact matching with APM values, which is a key point in the ground answer",

        "relevance": 0.7,
        "completeness": 0.6,
        "accuracy": 0.5
    }
}

The metrics are scored as follows:
- Relevance (0.7): While the response addresses tagging changes, it includes unnecessary information while missing key points about APM alignment
- Completeness (0.6): The response misses critical details about the revision number and exact matching requirements with APM values
- Accuracy (0.5): Several facts are incorrectly stated (date) or included without verification from the provided context, reducing the overall accuracy of the response

Question 8:
Response: {
    "is_correct": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated answer provides a more comprehensive and well-structured explanation of CloudHealth compared to the ground answer. It includes all the key points from the ground answer (multi-cloud reporting, cloud spend analysis) and expands upon them with additional useful information like access procedures, prerequisites, and available resources. However, the AI answer missed mentioning two specific details from the ground answer: 1) that there is no cost for teams to use CloudHealth, and 2) the limitation regarding amortized cost display and the recommendation to use cloud providers' portals for this data. The answer also provides valuable additional context about asset tracking and search capabilities, along with specific steps for accessing and using the platform, which makes it more actionable for users.",
