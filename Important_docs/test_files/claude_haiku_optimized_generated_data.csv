# CHAPTER 2 *Cloud-native application challenges*
## *2.4.4 Dealing with inconsistent data*
Having stored data in a relational data store like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL approach like Redis doesn't solve the problem of having inconsistent data across different stores. Because these stores should be hidden away by the service API, you will need to have mechanisms to check that the data that the services are handling is consistent. In dis- tributed systems, it is quite common to talk about ""eventual consistency,"" meaning that eventually the system will be consistent. Having eventual consistency is better than not having consistency at all. For this example, we can build a simple check mechanism that once in a while (imagine once a day) checks for the accepted talks in the Agenda service to see if they have been approved in the Call for Proposals service. If there is an entry that the Call hasn't approved for the Proposal Service (C4P), then we can raise some alerts or send an email to the conference organizers (figure 2.27).
<figure>
<figure_type>DIAGRAM</figure_type>
Figure 2.27 Consistency checks can run as CronJobs. We can execute checks against the application services on fixed intervals to make sure that the state is consistent. For example: (1) every day at midnight we query the Agenda Service (2) to verify that the published sessions are approved in the (3) Call For Proposals Service and a corresponding notification has been sent by the (4) Notifications Service.Title: Consistency Checks as CronJobs in Microservices Architecture
The diagram illustrates a microservices architecture implementing consistency checks through CronJobs. The system consists of four main components: Agenda Service, Call for Proposals Service, Notifications Service, and a Consistency Checker pod. The workflow shows how the Consistency Checker queries the Agenda Service daily at midnight (step 1), verifies the published sessions against the Call for Proposals Service (steps 2-3), and uses the Notifications Service (step 4) to alert about any inconsistencies. Each service is represented as a container with its respective pod, demonstrating a containerized architecture. The system ensures eventual consistency by validating that approved sessions in the Agenda Service match the approvals in the Call for Proposals Service.
</figure>
In figure 2.27, we can see how a CronJob (1) will be executed every X period, depend- ing on how important it is for us to fix consistency problems. Then it will query the Agenda service public APIs (2) to check which accepted proposals are being listed and compare that with the Call for Proposals service approved list (3). Finally, if any incon- sistency is found, an email can be sent using the Notifications service public APIs (4).
Think of the simple use case this application was designed for; what other checks would you need? One that immediately comes to mind is verifying that emails were sent correctly for Rejected and Approved proposals. For this use case, emails are really important, and we need to ensure those emails are sent to our accepted and rejected speakers.
## *2.4.5 Understanding how the application is working*
Distributed systems are complex beasts, and fully understanding how they work from day one can help you save time when things go wrong. This has pushed the monitor- ing, tracing, and telemetry communities hard to develop solutions that help us under- stand how things are working at any given time.

What is the BaaS architecture for a Dedicated subscription?,"Transaction log backups run every 15 minutes for Tier 1 and every 30 minutes for Tiers 2-4, all with 7-day retention.

Regular backups occur every 12 hours for Tiers 1-2 with 7-day retention, while Tiers 3-4 get daily backups with the same retention period.

All tiers receive weekly backups with extended 9-week retention for longer historical recovery options.

* One BaaS Platform Support RG to contain the following Rubrik Infrastructure Services per region:
Rubrik Cloud Cluster Elastic Storage (CCES) - for protecting SQL Servers on Azure VM
NAS Cloud Direct (NCD) VM's - for protecting File workloads such as Azure Files over SMB & NFS
Exocompute (AKS) - for providing auxillary services such as snapshot indexing and archiving as well as Azure Blob Protection data mover services.
* One BaaS Storage RG to contain the Storage Accounts and their Blob Containers used as one of the following types of Archive Locations:
Cloud Native Protection (CNP) Archive Locations - contains compressed and immutable, Azure VM Snapshots and Azure Blob backups
Azure SQL Immutable Backups (SQL) - contains immutable BACPAC copies of SQL DB/MI instances
NAS Cloud Direct Archive Locations (NCD) - contains immutable and compressed Azure Files backups

","**Backup as a Service (BaaS) Architecture for Dedicated Subscription**

**Key Architecture Components:**
* **Multi-Region Design**: The BaaS architecture spans two AWS regions (US-east-1 and us-west-2)
* **Architectural Components**:
  1. **Primary Region (US-east-1)**:
     - BaaS AWS Account
     - Cold Tier Storage
     - Supportive Infrastructure
     - Product AWS Account hosting:
       * Amazon EC2
       * Amazon RDS
       * Storage Bucket

  2. **Secondary Region (us-west-2)**:
     - Replicated BaaS AWS Account
     - Cold Tier Storage for disaster recovery

**Backup Process Workflow:**
1. **SLA Definition**: BaaS Team defines backup policy Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
2. **Backup Orchestration**: BaaS orchestrates backup process according to defined SLAs
3. **Backup Execution**: Backups performed using Cold Tier storage
4. **Geo-Replication**: Backups geographically replicated for disaster recovery

**Key BaaS Benefits:**
* Centralized and automated cloud resource backup
* Supports multiple cloud services (VMs, SQL, BLOB, S3, RDS)
* Secure, immutable, and encrypted backups
* Geo-replicated for disaster recovery
* Single management interface across cloud platforms
* Compliance with internal audit recommendations

Is there a RACI for this service?,"For BaaS service, the RACI matrix shows clear team responsibilities. The BaaS Platform Team is Responsible (R) for most technical aspects - network configuration, infrastructure provisioning, application onboarding, backup policies, monitoring, compliance, and all backup and recovery operations.

D&T Product Owner is Responsible (R) for application onboarding alongside the Platform Team, and Informed (I) about technical decisions.

Business Product Owner is mostly Consulted (C) or Informed (I), providing business input without direct implementation responsibility.

GCSO serves primarily in Consultative (C) roles for security and compliance matters, and is kept Informed (I) about technical operations.

This structure ensures clear accountability while maintaining appropriate collaboration across teams for successful BaaS implementation.","=== Confluence & SharePoint Results ===

Description: Finally, click the Add panel button again and go through creating a final panel. This panel will be titled Outbound Request Count, won't need any special units, and will use the following query: aliasByNode(stats_counts.web-api.outbound.\*.request-count, 3)
Click the back button a final time to return to the dashboard editor screen. In the upper-right corner of the screen, click the Save dashboard icon, give the dashboard a name of Web API Overview, and save the dashboard. The dashboard is now saved and will have a URL associated with it. If you were using an instance of Grafana per- manently installed for your organization, this URL would be a permalink that you could provide to others and would make a great addition to your project's README.
Feel free to drag the panels around and resize them until you get something that is aesthetically pleasing. In the upper right corner of the screen, you can also change the time range. Set it to ""Last 15 minutes,"" since you likely don't have data much older than that. Once you're done, your dashboard should look something like Figure 4-5.

Title: Outbound Request Count
The graph shows the outbound request count for a recipe-api service over a 15-minute period. The metric remains at 0 from 15:20 to approximately 15:27, then suddenly jumps to around 50 requests and maintains that level until about 15:32, where it drops back to near 0. The graph displays a clear step pattern with a sustained period of high activity followed by a return to baseline.

Title: Grafana Dashboard Metrics for Recipe API
The Grafana dashboard displays three key metrics for a recipe-api service over a time period from approximately 15:18 to 15:32. The dashboard includes three panels: 1) Outbound Request Count showing request volume reaching up to 60 requests, 2) Outbound Service Timing displaying response times with peaks around 2.5ms, and 3) Incoming Status Codes panel showing the distribution of HTTP status codes (200 and 500) over time. The metrics indicate some spikes in response times and a mix of successful (200) and error (500) responses.

This Grafana dashboard displays three key metrics for a recipe-api service over a time period from approximately 15:18 to 15:32. The dashboard consists of three panels:
1. Outbound Request Count: Shows request volume fluctuating between 0-60 requests
2. Outbound Service Timing: Displays response times ranging from 0.5ms to 2.5ms
3. Incoming Status Codes: Tracks HTTP status codes 200 (success) and 500 (error), with 200 responses showing a significant spike between 15:26 and 15:30, reaching around 40 requests, while 500 errors maintain a relatively constant low level throughout the period.

## Node.js Health Indicators
There is some generic health information about a running Node.js process that is also worth collecting for the dashboard. Modify your *web-api/consumer-http-metrics.js* file by adding the code from Example 4-8 to the end of the file. Restart the service and keep an eye on the data that is being generated. These new metrics represent values that can increase or decrease over time and are better represented as *Gauges.*

What is the SLA for a restoration request?,"The SLA for restoration requests varies by application type and tier. Production apps range from 1 hour (Tier 1) to 1+ days (Tiers 3-4), while non-production apps range from 1 business day (Tier 1) to 1+ business days (Tiers 2-4).","=== Confluence & SharePoint Results ===
Content: what we expect from a service and begin to collect related data to measure what we have in reality, it usually turns out that the service is not doing as well as we believed it was doing. Measured results are different because, without an SLA, we can count only these problems that somebody complained about. And in our mind, the service is doing well because there were only a few complaints in the past that appear to have been successfully resolved. The problem is that we did not receive complaints about all of the issues we actually have and, in reality, there might be a thousand cases in which end users just leave silently with a bad taste in their mouth. ## Nontechnical Solutions Technical solutions are not the limit of an SLA's potential. SLAs will give you a hand in other fields as well. The SLA determines, for instance, the right time to hand a new service over to the SRE team to support. This can be as simple as, ""If a product meets expectations (i.e., does not violate an SLA), the product is ready; otherwise, it is not."" When we talk about the handover procedures, the first thing that comes to mind is a big checklist with dozens of bullet points. It covers all possible aspects of the service, from architecture decisions and comprehensive administration documentation to monitoring alarms and troubleshooting runbooks. However, having all these bullets checked hardly gives you a strong sense of confidence that it is ready to be taken over. Unless you are freezing all activities except transition preparations, that is a very unusual thing to do; you will never be 100% sure that there will be no unpleasant sur- prises. Consider the following. All new software projects will have some prerequisites long before they pass architecture review and a couple of proof-of-concept models have been built. When it is believed that an application is ready to be officially launched and begin serving live production traffic, both SLA and SLO counters are reset⁴ and start to collect the real data. This is the starting point for the service condition meas- ure. Because the SLA defines statements over time (the frequently used period is one calendar year), the project should last in this state a significant portion of this time (several months or a quarter) to collect enough data points that confirm that the ser- vice is stable enough and that there are no agreement violation risks. If we add an ""expectations reaching"" goal as an additional checklist point along with the alarms limitations (amount of alarms for a service during the time period; e.g., ""No more than one alarm per two weeks""), we will be much more confident that ser- 4 You can set SLAs and SLOs for all environments (dev/test/prod), but they all will show the condition of the particular environment each. The metric might be the same for every environment, but values will be unique. When we launch a service, we reset all counters so that we avoid influences from the prelaunch data. **136** **Chapter 9: From SysAdmin to SRE in 8,963 Words**

Description: Someone eventually needs to understand the root cause of this issue, and correlation analysis can be used to further refine your understanding of what was happening. Similar to the analysis described in the previous chapter, you might compare slow requests from the last few minutes to faster requests from before the regression. This can identify specific operations that led to higher latency in the new version and help the team responsible for the inventory service understand how to address them.
Aggregate analysis can also help to identify more subtle changes in service perfor- mance. When comparing two sets of traces, we can look at the latency contributions related to arbitrary tags, operations, and services and how those contributions changed over time.
One method for doing so is to consider how the critical path changes between the baseline and regression sets. In this method, the critical path is computed for each trace. (The definition of the ""critical path"" is covered in Chapter 8.) The average con- tribution for each service and operation is then determined for each of the two sets. Services and operations are ranked by the differences between these two averages.
Table 9-2 shows an example of this method. In this example, the inventory service continues to have a big impact on the changes in performance. Here the write-cache operation contributes more than five times more to the critical path in the regression set than in the baseline set. This is strong evidence that this operation is the cause of the performance regression.
*Table 9-2. Critical path contributions in baseline and regression traces*
| Service/Operation | Baseline | Regression | Change |
|-|-|-|-|
| inventory/write-cache | 63.1 ms | 368 ms | +305 ms |
| inventory-db/update | 1.75 ms | 2.26 ms | +516 ms |
| memcached/set | 4.94 ms | 4.71 ms | -230 ms |
| inventory/update-inventor | 15.2 ms | 14.8 ms | -470 ms |
| inventory/database-update | 32 ms | 30.6 ms | -1.4 ms |
Another method for understanding performance changes is to consider every tag found in either set of traces. For each tag, all spans in each set on which that tag appears are enumerated and the average duration of those spans is computed for each set. Tags are then ranked based on the difference between those two averages.
Table 9-3 shows an example of what this might look like. Four tags are shown with changes in average duration between a few hundred milliseconds and more than a second. The tag item-time: new undergoes the biggest change between the baseline set and the regression, moving from 114 ms to 1.24 seconds. This would be a great place to start looking for what code changed between releases. In other cases, these results might indicate a change not in the application itself but in the behavior of
